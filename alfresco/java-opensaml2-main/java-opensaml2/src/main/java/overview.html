<p>The OpenSAML library allows developers to work with SAML messages as Java bean objects. This library supports the
SAML 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 specification.</p>
<p>The OpenWS library, contained within OpenSAML, provides a growing set of tools to work with web services at a low
level. These tools include classes for creating and reading SOAP messages, transport-independent clients for connecting
to web services, and various transports for use with those clients.</p>
<p>The XMLTooling library, contained within OpenSAML, provides the ability to work with XML as regular Java beans.
This is similar to the <a href="http://java.sun.com/webservices/jaxb/">Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB)</a> , <a
    href="http://xmlbeans.apache.org/">XMLBeans</a> , and <a href="http://xstream.codehaus.org/">XStream</a> libraries.
It differs from these libraries in three main ways:
<ul>
    <li>Much finer control to developer for what happens during the marshalling and unmarshalling processes</li>
    <li>Much more extensible, allowing various implementations of all of it's XMLObjects</li>
    <li>Support for XML Digital Signatures and Encryption</li>
</ul>
